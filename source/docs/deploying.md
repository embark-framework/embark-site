title: Deploying DApps to IPFS and Swarm
---

Deploying to IPFS
=================

To deploy a dapp to IPFS, all you need to do is run a local IPFS node and then run ``embark upload ipfs``. If you want to deploy to the livenet then after configuring you account on ``config/blockchain.json`` on the ``livenet`` environment then you can deploy to that chain by specifying the environment ``embark upload ipfs livenet``.

Deploying to SWARM
==================

To deploy a dapp to SWARM, all you need to do is run a local SWARM node and then run ``embark upload swarm``.
