Testing Ethereum Contracts
==========================

## How to

You can run specs with ``embark test``. Invoking this command runs all the test files under ``test/``. You can also run a specific test file with `embark test <path/test_filename.js>`.

Pass the `--gasDetails` option to `embark test` to have the gas cost printed for each contract deployment when running the tests.

By default, tests are run using an Ethereum simulator (ganache). You can use the `--node` option to change that behavior. Passing `--node embark` to `embark test` will use the Ethereum node associated with an already running embark process. You can also specify a custom endpoint, for example:
`embark test --node ws://localhost:8556`.

Embark includes a testing library to run & test your contracts in <abbr title="Ethereum Virtual Machine">EVM</abbr> quickly.
<pre><code class="javascript">// test/simple_storage_spec.js
/*global contract, config, it, embark, assert, web3*/
const SimpleStorage = require('Embark/contracts/SimpleStorage');
let accounts;

config({
  contracts: {
    "SimpleStorage": {
      args: [100],
      onDeploy: ["SimpleStorage.methods.setRegistar(web3.eth.defaultAccount).send()"] // example
    }
  }
}, (err, theAccounts) => {
  accounts = theAccounts;
});

contract("SimpleStorage", function () {
  this.timeout(0);

  it("should set constructor value", async function () {
    let result = await SimpleStorage.methods.storedData().call();
    assert.strictEqual(parseInt(result, 10), 100);
  });

  it("set storage value", async function () {
    await SimpleStorage.methods.set(150).send();
    let result = await SimpleStorage.methods.get().call();
    assert.strictEqual(parseInt(result, 10), 499650);
  });
});
</code></pre>

## Global variables

Embark makes a couple of variables and functions available for you globally:

- `contract()`: Same as Mocha's `describe`
- `config()`: Function to deploy your contracts using custom configurations. Calls back with accounts
- `web3`: Web3 object
- `assert`: Node's assert
- Mocha functions: `describe()`, `it()`, `before()`, etc.

### Contracts

You can require your contracts using `require('Embark/contracts/YOUR_CONTRACT_NAME');`

The returned object is the fully deployed contract that you can interact with.

{% note info About required contracts %}
The contracts that you require at the top of the file will not be populated until you run `config()`, since it is `config()` that deploys the contracts.
{% endnote %}

### EmbarkJS

You can require `EmbarkJS` using `require('Embark/EmbarkJS');`

It possesses all the great features that you are used to.

## Configuring accounts

You can use the same account settings that you would use in [contracts.js](/docs/contracts_deployment.html#Using-accounts-in-a-wallet)

That way, you can use a specific account for your test.

You can even optionally set the balance of each account using real units eg: "5eth", "125gwei", "500 szabo".
If the unit is not specified, Embark will assume weis.

<pre><code class="javascript">// test/simple_storage_spec.js

config({
  "deployment": {
    "accounts": [
      {
        "privateKey": "your_private_key",
        balance: "600000Kwei"
      },
      {
        "privateKeyFile": "path/to/file", // You can put more than one key, separated by , or ;
        balance: "42 shannon"
      },
      {
        "mnemonic": "12 word mnemonic",
        "addressIndex": "0", // Optional. The index to start getting the address
        "numAddresses": "1", // Optional. The number of addresses to get
        "hdpath": "m/44'/60'/0'/0/" // Optional. HD derivation path
      }
    ]
  }
});

describe("SimpleStorage", function() {

});
</code></pre>

## Configuring node

By default Embark will use an internal VM to run the tests, however you can also specify a node to connect to and run the tests there, just like in `contracts.js`.

<pre><code class="javascript">// test/simple_storage_spec.js

config({
  deployment: {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8545,
    "type": "rpc"
  }
});

describe("SimpleStorage", function() {
});
</code></pre>

## Accessing accounts

The callback used in the function ``config`` will let you access the accounts configured in the EVM.
You can assign them to a variable and use them in your tests.
That callback is optional. If you do not need the accounts, you do not have to supply it.

<pre><code class="javascript">let accounts;

config({
  contracts: {
    "SimpleStorage": {
      args: [100]
    }
  }
}, (err, theAccounts) => {
  accounts = theAccounts;
});
</code></pre>

## Creating contract instances in your tests

Embark handles the deployment of your contracts through the function ``config``.
However you can use the contract's deploy function to deploy it manually.

<pre><code class="javascript">/*global contract, it, assert, before*/
const SimpleStorage = require('Embark/contracts/SimpleStorage');

contract("SimpleStorage Deploy", function () {
  let SimpleStorageInstance;

  before(async function() {
    SimpleStorageInstance = await SimpleStorage.deploy({arguments: [150]}).send();
  });

  it("should set constructor value", async function () {
    let result = await SimpleStorageInstance.methods.storedData().call();
    assert.strictEqual(parseInt(result, 10), 150);
  });
});
</code></pre>

## Code coverage

Embark allows you to generate a coverage report for your Solidity contracts by passing the `--coverage` option on the `embark test` command. The generated report looks like this:

![Coverage Report: Files](/coverage-files.png)

This gives us a birds-eye view on the state of the coverage of our contracts: how many of the functions were called, how many lines were hit, even whether all the branch cases were executed. When selecting a file, a more detailed report is produced. Here's what it looks like:
