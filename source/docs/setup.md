title: Setup
---

Once Embark is installed, you can create a demo DApp with:

``` bash
$ embark demo
$ cd embark_demo
```

If you want to create a blank DApp then:

``` bash
$ embark new <YourDAppName>
$ cd <YourDAppName>
```

Once initialised, here's what your project folder will look like:

``` plain
.
├── app/
├── contracts/
├── config
|   ├── blockchain.json
|   └── contracts.json
|   └── storage.json
|   └── communication.json
|   └── webserver.json
└── test/
└── dist/
└── chains.json
└── embark.json
```

### app/

DApp Web code goes here. See embark.json on how you customize the pipeline.

### contracts/

Smart Contracts go here. When active, Embark will automatically compile, deploy & track contracts in this directory. Embark will detect changes made to a contract and re-deploy it and its dependencies if necessary.

### config/

The configuration files for the different components of the stack can be found here.

**blockchain.json**
Contains the configuration used for embark to run a node with go-ethereum or a simulator.

**contracts.json**
Configuration for contracts, including their arguments, relationship between them. It's also possible to specify where to deploy the contracts and how the dapp should attempt to connect to a node.
Please see [Configuring Contracts](contracts.html) for more details.

**storage.json**

You can configure what storage component to use (e.g IPFS) and its config details including what node to connect to, get & uplaod files from, etc..

**communication.json**

You can configure what communication component to use (e.g Whisper) and its config details including what node to connect to.

**webserver.json**

Dev web server config, specifically the host and port to listen to.

### test/

Tests Folder. This where you typically put the code to test smart contracts. Embark includes a [testing framework](testing.html)

### dist/

The build output of your dapp will be put here. You can then distribute your app with this folder

### chains.json

This file is used to keep track of the deployed contracts in each chain. See chains file documentation for more information

### embark.json

Embark is quite flexible and you can configure your own directory structure using ``embark.json``. This file is also used to specify embark plugins and other configurations. More information can be found in [configuring embark.json](configuration.html)
